We are a team of Three people and have done the Text Summarization project under professor Jue Guo. We have included 6 project files.

Sample gist of each of the files is as follows:

1. GRU_CrossEntropy_Adam.ipynb
   
   Here we have used GRU model with CrossEntropy Loss and Adam as optimizer.
  
   Achieved an accuracy of 83.65.

2. GRU_NLL_SGD.ipynb
 
   Here we have used GRU model with NLL Loss and SGD as optimizer.

   Achieved an accuracy of 79.22.

3. LSTM_CrossEntropy_Adam.ipynb

   Here we have used LSTM model with CrossEntropy Loss and Adam as optimizer.

   Achieved an accuracy of 73.16.

4. LSTM_NLL_SGD.ipynb
   
   Here we have used LSTM model with NLL Loss and SGD as optimizer.
  
   Achieved an accuracy of 74.32.

5. predefined_models.ipynb
   
   We have implemented many predefined models.
   
   The main models of them are BART, T5, Pegasus, MBART.
   
   We have used BLEU score and Rouge score as Evaluation metrics.
   
   And observed that BART and Pegasus achieved decent scores.
